# Example Airtable+Slack App: Bug Tracker

## Overview

This is an example [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/) app built with the [Bolt for JavaScript framework](https://slack.dev/bolt-js) that has a [Global Shortcut](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/shortcuts/using#global_shortcuts) which displays a [modal](https://api.slack.com/surfaces/modals#:~:text=Modals%20provide%20focused%20spaces%20ideal,of%20any%20other%20interface%20element.) (aka form). Form submissions undergo validation and are sent to an [Airtable](https://airtable.com) base using [airtable.js](https://github.com/airtable/airtable.js) to call [Airtable's REST API](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313985-Public-REST-API).

The example code makes use of Slack [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) which uses WebSockets (instead of HTTP) to receive events from Slack.
